# resumeProjects
This repository exists to display projects made by Matt Hoffman for employers to take a look at. The current project is an <a href='https://people.rit.edu/mvh9602/330/project1/project1.html'>audio visualizer</a> themed around the music of Pink Floyd. It uses Canvas to draw data based on audio analysis and bitmap analysis. It also uses synthesis to create a playable piano with multiple voices on your keyboard.

This is a screenshot of my audio visualizer. There are a number of options for interaction that can change what you see and hear.

Here is an image of the visualizer playing with default settings. Some parts track changes in the frquency spectrum, some track changes in amplitude, and some simply change over time.

The RGB mapping effect is one of my bitmap effects. This one is a bit strange, forcing individual pixels to either become red, blue, or green using an algorithm I wrote.

The noise effect doesn't make the music noisier, but rather adds in random dark pixels throughout the image, like TV static.

The gradient effect changes the background color over time, switching between red, blue, and green.

When you combine all the visual effects together, you get an experience just as trippy as the music you're hearing!

The best way to enjoy this project is to use it yourself using the link at the top of the page, ideally with your sound on. Beyond what I showed above, there is also options for filtering the sound, adjusting the volume, or even playing along with the music by using your keyboard in the way the graphic at the bottom of the page displays. You can even switch between classic signals to change how the keys sound.
